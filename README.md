## Making Changes to the Tool
If you have made any changes to the .py files within the repository, you will need to update the executable and installer.

### Updating the Executable
Using pyinstaller, you can create a single file executable of all the python files by running the code `pyinstaller --icon=icon.ico --name "Vulnerability Scanner" --noconsole --uac-admin GUI.py`.

### Updating the Installer
Now that the executable is updated, the installer will also to be updated if you wish to distribute, or have for personal use, a single .exe to install and run the program. To Create an updated installer I am using the program [Inno Setup Installer](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php), which will run the VS.iss file inside of the installer folder to create the new installer.

As of version 2.1, the imports from the Plotly library have been trimmed.
