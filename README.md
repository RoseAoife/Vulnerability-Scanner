# Making Changes to the Tool

## Updating the Installer
If you have made any changes to the .py files within the repository, you will need to update the executable and installer

## Updating the Executable
Using pyinstaller, you can create a single file executable of all the python files by running the code `pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico --name "Vulnerability Scanner" --noconsole GUI.py`

## Updating the Installer
Now that the executable is updated, the installer will also to be updated if you wish to distribute, or hvae for personal use, a single .exe to install and run the program. To Create an updated installer I am using the program [Inno Setup Installer](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php), which will run the VS.iss file inside of the installer folder to create the new installer.
