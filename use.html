      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <h3>Installing Vulnerability Scanner</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the file "installer.exe" from <a href=https://github.com/tynanpmatthews/Vulnerability-Scanner/releases/latest> here</a></li>
        <li>Run installer.exe</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions shown on the installer</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Using Vulnerability Scanner</h3>
      <p>Vulnerability Scanner can be launched by double clicking on its icon. If met with an error about it needing
        administrative privileges, right click on it, select "run as administrator", and then enter your password
        when prompted.</p>
      <p>Once open, there are two categories of tests shown: simple tests and advanced tests. Simple tests are short
        tests that can be performed at the same time (select "default - run all tests" to do this), while advanced tests
        must be run individually. Although it's recomended that for simple tests you use the default option, you can also
        select an individual simple test to run instead, similarly to how the advanced tests are selected. Once you have
        made a selection, push "Run Test".</p>
      <p>You can view the results of the test(s) on the panel to the right. This will indicate whether or not your systems
        passes the test. If your system failed a test, that could mean that there is a vulnerability on your computer that
        should be fixed. For each failed test, this output screen will also display a link to official documentation on how
        to correct this vulnerability. For advanced tests, the output might look different, but will contain instructions
        regarding how to proceed.</p>
      <p>Please note that if the computer is not yours (e.g. if it was issued to you by your
      employer), there may be a reason for these vulnerabilities and it is worth discussing it with your IT department before
      making any changes. These tests are safe to run on any computer because Vulnerability Scanner does not affect your
      settings, but its advice is generated with the interests of people working from a personal computer in mind. It can still
      apply to company-issued computers, but not without consulting your IT department first.</p>
