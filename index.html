  <p>Vulnerability Scanner is your next step in taking security into your own hands. This tool is
    designed to help Windows 10 users identify security vulnerabilities on their systems and connect
    them with resources to resolve them. Although Vulnerability Scanner was created with the situations
    of remote workers in mind, it is also flexible enough to accommodate anybody using Windows 10 on
    a personal computer.</p>
  <p>By performing a customizable set of security tests, this tool provides you with a personalized list
    of vulnerabilities on you system and refers you to Microsoft’s official documentation for resolving
    each of them. Rather than automatically resolving the vulnerabilities by making changes to your system,
    this tool simply connects you to the information needed to take matters into their own hands after the
    vulnerabilities have been identified. Being designed from a strictly educational and information standpoint,
    Vulnerability Scanner is completely safe to use for all users with no risk of damaging your settings or data.</p>
  <p>Please note that this is not an all-inclusive solution to Windows 10 security, nor is it meant to automatically
    resolve any vulnerabilities. It is meant entirely as an educational tool to help users identify several common
    security risks and connect them with professional resources to resolve them. To further secure your system, it is
    strongly recommended that you engage in further research beyond the tests provided by this tool.</p>
