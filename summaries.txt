[Default]
(This option will run all of the basic tests back-to-back, providing a cumulative report of your system's vulnerabilities and 
resources for resolving them. This is the recommended option for most users because it accounts for many of the most common
vulnerabilities for remote workers. However, due to the more specific constraints of some tests this option will not
run the advanced tests, which must be run individually. After completing the basic tests from this option, it is highly
recommended that you run the advanced tests to further secure your system.)

[SSH Check]
(SSH, or secure shell, is a commonly used protocol that allows remote access to a computer. This is useful in
corporate environments for system administration and transferring files, but without proper management and monitoring
by a trained IT department, this runs the risk of opening a backdoor for malicious users to remotely access the system.
Computers can be reached via SSH through port 22, so this test checks to see if your computer has that port open,
leaving it vulnerable to SSH connections, and if so, it provides instructions for closing the port to secure the system
from this.)

[Admin Password Check]
(Your administrator's password is what stands between a malicious user and full access to your system’s files, terminal, and more.
Password cracking technology has made massive strides in recent decades, so with some simple tools that are completely free,
a simple and common password can be cracked in less than a second. To run this test, you can enter your admin password to
have it cross-referenced against a list of the 500 most commonly used passwords (and therefore some of the most easily cracked).
In addition, the test will rate the password on its complexity. If the password isn't complex, or 
if it’s on the list, it provides instructions for changing it to one more secure.)

[Firewall Status]
(Your firewall is your computer’s primary defense against malicious network traffic entering your system. It uses a
system of rules to determine which traffic is safe and which is suspicious so that it can stop dangerous connections
before they can do any harm. Due to its many customization options, it’s possible for parts of the Windows Firewall to be
disabled, weakening your system’s defense against potential threats. This test will check the status of your firewall,
and if part of it is disabled, it provides instructions for enabling it in full.)

[Version Check]
(Each Windows 10 update comes with important security-related changes to resolve any newly identified vulnerabilities from
previous versions. These include semi-annual updates, or versions, as well as smaller and more frequent updates known as builds.
Due to the smaller scale of builds, it can be easy to miss the release of a new build despite its potentially critical importance
 in patching a major vulnerability. This test compares the current build of your system to the most recently released build and
 notifies you if they don’t match, providing instructions for updating your system.)

[Geolocation Scan]
(Because of the highly globalized nature of the internet, it’s common for foreign groups to connect to a computer for malicious
purposes. Whether that’s to secretly collect your personal information, use your system as a pawn in a larger operation,
or something else entirely, these connections can often go completely unnoticed when unchecked. This test scans your computer
for any current connections and allows you to choose which locations are suspicous. Should there be any connections to
those countries, it will notify you of the connections and provide instructions on terminating them.)

[Scan Ports]
(Ports are communication endpoints on a system that can be used by different services and protocols when communicating on
a network. While ports play a vital role in any network-related activity, such as web browsing, streaming, file sharing, or
anything else, when left unchecked and without strict firewall rules to keep them secure, they provide attackers with easy
remote access to your system. Although there are thousands of ports on any given system, the lower numbered ports are the most
commonly used. This test checks the status of the first 1000 ports, letting you know if any of them are open in your firewall
and providing instructions for correcting this. <b>This test will take some time.</b>)
